# qt-faststart

this source code is from ffmpeg project. I put it here because this is the only one C program that does not use any external source code and libraries, just standard C Library.
To compile:

gcc -o qt-faststart qt-faststart.c 


To use: 

./qt-faststart input.mp4 output.mp4 


Easy, right?
